//specs for the text analyzer 
In this challenge, you'll implement a small web app that runs basic text analytics on user submitted text. We provide initial HTML and CSS files, and you'll be responsible for adding CSS classes to the HTML for your JavaScript code to hook into, and for writing JavaScript code that computes and displays 3 metrics:

Total word count of the submitted text
Unique word count of the submitted text
Average word length in characters of the submitted text
The program should print each of these metrics in the appropriate area in the results section.

Spend a few minutes familiarizing with the HTML and CSS files. Remember, to complete this challenge you do not need to add new HTML elements or CSS rules â€” that's all been set up for you.

You'll need to write JavaScript code that achieves the objectives listed above. That will require you to add some CSS classes for hooking your jQuery event listeners (and to that end, we recommend you follow the convention of prefixing these class names with js- to preserve the separation of your application logic from the presentation layer).

Here are some pointers to get you started:

You need to link to jQuery in the index.html file
You need to link to app.js in index.html
In the HTML file, the results section defaults to having a .hidden class applied. Your application code will need to remove that class when it's time to display results.
You'll need to add CSS classes for your DOM manipulation layer to target (and use the js- prefix!)
